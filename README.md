# blockchain
The code you see in this section is a small blockchain that I am developing
More code for this blockchain from
https://github.com/dvf
Received but with improved performance
For example, adding a list of transactions to the received hash

If you see a problem in the code or have a better understanding of blockchain, please help me.
